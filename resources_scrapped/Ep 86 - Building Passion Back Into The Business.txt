[00:00:07.370] - Chris
Welcome back to the Head Heart and Boots Podcast. I'm Chris.

[00:00:10.870] - Brandon
And I'm Brandon. Join us as we wrestle with what it takes to transform ourselves and the businesses we lead.

[00:00:17.590] - Chris
Man, I love this industry. That might be a bullish expenditure, which is what I was trying to explain.

[00:00:23.960] - Chris
To you guys for those of you.

[00:00:25.870] - Brandon
That just jumped into that. And I don't know if Joel will.

[00:00:27.870] - Chris
Keep it in there or not, but.

[00:00:29.260] - Brandon
That was negotiations happening, and what I attempted to do was slide something in that I want right at the last minute before hitting record so that Chris.

[00:00:38.740] - Chris
Couldn'T tell me no.

[00:00:40.670] - Brandon
I don't know. Do you have business partners? That's a methodology you can attempt to deploy.

[00:00:46.670] - Chris
I'm just suggesting I like to buy.

[00:00:49.440] - Chris
New shiny things, too, and some of.

[00:00:51.750] - Chris
Them have disappointed me.

[00:00:53.110] - Chris
Well, that is true.

[00:00:55.760] - Brandon
Many things.

[00:00:57.250] - Chris
In fact, the sad story is probably 80% of the shiny things that I buy end up pointing me right.

[00:01:03.240] - Brandon
Yeah. If not immediately, not too long, with.

[00:01:05.970] - Chris
A very short honeymoon period. Hey, dude. How's it going, man?

[00:01:09.830] - Brandon
Hey.

[00:01:10.070] - Chris
Good. Yeah. How are you?

[00:01:11.100] - Brandon
Welcome.

[00:01:11.480] - Chris
Glad you could join us, Chris. I was just saying I really enjoy this new podcast set up.

[00:01:17.080] - Chris
For those of you that are listening and you haven't made your way over.

[00:01:19.790] - Chris
To our YouTube channel, it's evolving.

[00:01:22.990] - Chris
It's an evolution. We're a small business. We don't have, like, designers on our staff that are just sort of constantly leveling up, and we show up to a brand new completed studio. It's a work in progress.

[00:01:32.970] - Brandon
That would be pretty sweet.

[00:01:34.020] - Chris
We do actually have a designer on the team. They do a lot of other things, too.

[00:01:39.580] - Brandon
That's right.

[00:01:40.260] - Chris
But we have a custom made podcast table that's really freaking cool that you found.

[00:01:46.160] - Chris
Oh, man.

[00:01:46.760] - Chris
Yeah, this thing got a new backdrop on the way.

[00:01:48.820] - Brandon
Yeah, we'll be updating that in the next few weeks, I think.

[00:01:52.610] - Chris
And we got some comfortable chairs coming that'll swivel and have a sit up a little bit higher. But anyway, it's really fun.

[00:01:58.020] - Chris
New things are fun.

[00:01:59.590] - Brandon
That's right. Let's rock some sponsors.

[00:02:01.890] - Chris
And then you had a line on.

[00:02:04.090] - Brandon
A show topic that I'm actually kind of psyched about. I think it'll be good.

[00:02:06.950] - Chris
Yeah, dude, me too.

[00:02:07.690] - Chris
Dive into it.

[00:02:08.310] - Chris
Me, too.

[00:02:08.720] - Chris
Yeah.

[00:02:09.040] - Brandon
I'm going to go liftify, man. So you just hold your horses. Did I say that right? Because just for those of you that are listening, chris has been correcting my understanding and interpretation of old sayings. So we started the morning with for all intensive purposes.

[00:02:25.130] - Chris
Well, lo and behold, that is bass act words.

[00:02:28.340] - Brandon
That is wrong. That is incorrect.

[00:02:30.650] - Chris
It is not for all intensive purposes. It is for all intents and purposes right.

[00:02:41.570] - Chris
You have very few. I will commit to identifying your Idiosyncrasies when I notice them. Hey, careful with the and I'll try to pick the right timing where you're in a position to receive that feedback.

[00:02:52.530] - Brandon
That's right. My ego is fragile.

[00:02:53.980] - Chris
Timing matters for all of us. You know what?

[00:02:55.620] - Brandon
I'm not digging very much. This new camera angle makes my arms.

[00:02:59.010] - Chris
Look smaller than yours.

[00:03:00.270] - Brandon
Yeah. I think we're going to scrap the whole studio.

[00:03:02.480] - Chris
I'm noticing that, and I really appreciate it.

[00:03:04.640] - Brandon
Yeah. See, before, I was winning.

[00:03:06.160] - Chris
I thought you did that on purpose.

[00:03:07.140] - Brandon
No, I don't. I didn't.

[00:03:09.350] - Chris
And I am not happy with it.

[00:03:11.370] - Chris
We're all intense, and you have very few of those idiosyncrasies. And you know what? If you say it fast enough, I think probably 90% of the time, people don't even notice anyways, because, like, oh, yeah, for all intents purposes, is what he just said.

[00:03:21.860] - Chris
I would bet that people don't know most.

[00:03:25.170] - Brandon
Maybe I'm the only neanderthal in the group.

[00:03:27.300] - Chris
Maybe I just added some value there.

[00:03:28.690] - Chris
I think that we've just trained.

[00:03:30.430] - Brandon
We just conducted some training.

[00:03:31.990] - Chris
I'm going to have to hit the.

[00:03:32.880] - Brandon
Gym a little bit harder. I'm really intimidated by this new I.

[00:03:36.070] - Chris
Think that every time I go, your biceps, I'm like, God, I need to catch up a little bit here.

[00:03:40.540] - Brandon
All right, let's get into this. Because people are like, guys, I do have an hour trip between jobs, but I don't want to listen to you. That's right. All right, let's get into this. Hey, Liftify. You guys know that they've been a key sponsor of the show for quite some time. And you guys have also heard us talk at great length. That partnership has to be a two way street, meaning there has to be real value for our listeners and our clients for somebody to be on that roster. And Liftify, as you guys know, we are huge fans.

[00:04:08.390] - Chris
They produce results.

[00:04:09.560] - Brandon
They do it consistently. It's not voodoo magic. They have a system, a process that you can plug into your organization. They will chase those five star Google reviews for you. And then, of course, as you ramp those up, as you start getting the actual number of reviews that you've earned, then the SEO applications, the findability, the searchability of your organization just skyrockets. And then the key piece that Zach and the team constantly preach is this idea that you need to have them consistently and they need to be relevant and fresh. Meaning we can't do a push for 90 days, get a bunch of reviews, and then let it hang for the rest of the year. Google recognizes that is not a value in terms of how people are seeing your business.

[00:04:53.980] - Chris
So, again, Liftify comfloodlight all sorts of.

[00:04:58.290] - Brandon
Opportunities there for you to get that onboarded in a way that'll start skyrocketing what's happening with your brand online.

[00:05:04.470] - Chris
Yeah. And then CNR magazine, we've been ringing.

[00:05:08.470] - Chris
This bell for a while now, and we really do.

[00:05:11.250] - Chris
We like CNR.

[00:05:12.680] - Chris
We're advertisers in CNR. We put our money where our mouth.

[00:05:16.000] - Chris
Is, and we really enjoy Michelle and the team.

[00:05:19.580] - Chris
Actually, I just saw an article by Marcy Richardson. Did you see that on Culture?

[00:05:23.730] - Chris
Company culture.

[00:05:24.800] - Chris
Really good person to oh, my gosh, especially, I mean, guarantee. They got some really interesting stuff happening.

[00:05:29.520] - Chris
There in the south.

[00:05:30.710] - Chris
She is one of the leaders at the helm there. So talked about some of their culture practices internally. It's really great. So this stuff is relevant. Michelle has a way of connecting with.

[00:05:41.070] - Chris
Talented, thought leaders in the industry and.

[00:05:44.590] - Chris
Getting them on board. And so she's got a great stable of writers from all different companies and areas of the industry that produce content. So this isn't just random content that they're buying. This isn't stock photo kind of content that they're putting out. It's really good. It's really in touch with what's happened in the industry. Whether you're a supplier, you're recruiting, whatever could be a great place to advertise. Very cost effective for us. We've seen a lot of results, a lot of audience growth on our podcast.

[00:06:13.010] - Chris
From our advertising on CNR, and also, too, it's just a great way to stay up.

[00:06:18.510] - Chris
She's scooping stories all the time. In fact, it was funny. We were having a conversation with a really prominent industry executive, and he was acting all tight lipped about I think I mentioned this on a previous podcast, but telling us about an acquisition that was just getting ready to be announced. And literally like, five minutes before the call, I saw it on my LinkedIn feed from Michelle and CNR. They were breaking that story.

[00:06:42.710] - Brandon
That's right. They were already all over it.

[00:06:44.770] - Chris
I felt pretty important.

[00:06:46.210] - Chris
Anyhow, so there we go.

[00:06:48.230] - Chris
There's our sponsors.

[00:06:49.130] - Chris
Check them out. So today yeah, this is interesting. Okay, so kind of setting the table.

[00:06:55.960] - Chris
So where did this come from? How did I come back to this? Because I have a notes file, like probably many of you, in my iPhone. Oh, yeah, I should write this down.

[00:07:04.460] - Chris
Come back to that. And then this past week, I was.

[00:07:06.910] - Chris
Having a conversation with one of our larger clients, and they're frustrated. There's some frustration right now with turnover, and probably everybody listening to this can relate to what that feels like. Maybe you're struggling with it right now, maybe you're not.

[00:07:20.830] - Chris
But I think there's this sense from them that they can't quite find out.

[00:07:25.150] - Chris
Why they feel like they're doing the right things. They're respectful to their people, they're paying people competitively. All the things that you kind of want to check, all those boxes. It's like, why are we struggling? Why are we losing people? And so on the heels of that.

[00:07:39.970] - Chris
Conversation, there's been a number of other.

[00:07:42.420] - Chris
Conversations I've been in this week, all around this topic. And I went back to our notes, and I found this quote from Jordan.

[00:07:48.010] - Chris
Peterson that I heard on a podcast.

[00:07:50.610] - Chris
A few weeks ago.

[00:07:51.500] - Chris
And I just think, man, it's so good. So Jordan Peterson, he said this, and.

[00:07:56.810] - Chris
I tried to get it verbatim. I listened to it like 14 times. Tried to record it as close as I could. What you want to do is build.

[00:08:03.180] - Chris
A company on the intrinsic alignment of interest.

[00:08:08.590] - Chris
Each person pursuing a goal that they.

[00:08:11.140] - Chris
Intrinsically value that they're willing to work.

[00:08:14.340] - Chris
For, dedicate themselves to and sacrifice themselves for.

[00:08:18.830] - Chris
And then you want each of these.

[00:08:20.520] - Chris
Goals to be serving a superordinate goal. A superordinate goal that unites and moves the entire team ahead.

[00:08:28.770] - Chris
Then you don't have to use coercion.

[00:08:31.910] - Chris
Or manipulation to motivate people.

[00:08:35.010] - Chris
That last sentence, that is what really grabbed me man.

[00:08:38.810] - Chris
I was thinking about that. Coercion or manipulation to motivate people.

[00:08:42.630] - Chris
There's so many different ways we could break this down and talk about it. But what does that mean coercion and manipulation? Because I think we do that and.

[00:08:52.430] - Chris
I think in some ways that is part of the playbook in business.

[00:08:55.520] - Chris
Okay.

[00:08:55.920] - Chris
Coercion and manipulation have a really negative sounding connotation but what is it? Well I think part of it is it's carrot and stick.

[00:09:02.520] - Chris
Yeah it's like hey you do this this is going to happen.

[00:09:06.560] - Chris
You don't do this, this is going to happen. Right? And that's what we call often accountability. And so I think what he's saying is this is an ideal target that he just described. Are we ever going to get there entirely with all of our people?

[00:09:21.120] - Brandon
Probably not, probably not.

[00:09:22.530] - Chris
But I think what he's saying is, in the highest performing teams, if you.

[00:09:26.810] - Chris
Look behind the curtain, what you have is a tremendous amount of alignment between.

[00:09:35.130] - Chris
What the people, the parts of the.

[00:09:37.060] - Chris
Team really want, not what.

[00:09:39.240] - Chris
They say they want so they can get the raise, not so what they say they want. Or like so that they don't get fired.

[00:09:45.730] - Chris
But like these people really they have something that they are engaged with that.

[00:09:54.110] - Chris
Is personally satisfying to them and that all of those people or a majority of those people probably more realistic language.

[00:10:04.050] - Brandon
Are never going to be 100%.

[00:10:05.890] - Chris
Their things that they're driven by are aligned with the vision and direction of.

[00:10:12.500] - Chris
The company and what the company is trying to do.

[00:10:15.220] - Chris
And that when you have that that baseline accountability.

[00:10:20.080] - Chris
These accountability structures of don't do this, don't do that. We always do this, we never do that.

[00:10:25.710] - Chris
The punishment, the write ups, it becomes unnecessary. And I think we've all seen examples of this.

[00:10:36.800] - Chris
There's some iconic examples of this kind of alignment.

[00:10:40.070] - Chris
Well I think the thing is, is.

[00:10:42.010] - Brandon
Right when we start a concept from a quote we need to remember that in those cases most of the time.

[00:10:48.110] - Chris
What'S being communicated is the pinnacle.

[00:10:51.250] - Brandon
Yeah like in best case scenario right.

[00:10:54.690] - Chris
If in a test tube completely unaffected.

[00:10:57.710] - Brandon
By outside this is what you would ultimately shoot for. This is the aspirational goal. Just for relevance though the reality is you're not going to necessarily hit that. The idea is index heavier on the intrinsic building into the system that it creates this engagement and loyalty to it intrinsically inside the employee so that there's less of a need.

[00:11:22.330] - Chris
I totally agree with you. And I also think though, we have these familiar icons that we see.

[00:11:27.840] - Chris
And I think as owners and leaders.

[00:11:30.340] - Chris
In service companies, where we do this really hard work and it's hard to find people that want to do this kind of work and all that kind of stuff, it's just difficult for us to make the connection sometimes to companies like Apple.

[00:11:39.380] - Chris
I think Apple at least has been.

[00:11:41.940] - Chris
A type of example of this. There's other companies that I admire like Bridgewater Associates, ray Dalia, one of the most successful investment funds of all time, amazon, these kind of companies that there's such an allure and draw to what they're about, what they accomplish, what their vision is for, how they affect their industries.

[00:12:01.910] - Chris
I think they tap into some of this. Right?

[00:12:03.960] - Chris
Programmers want to work at Apple because of what it means, what they get to do, what they get to create, right? Like Apple can get any talent that they want, period.

[00:12:14.510] - Chris
Because there's something special that all of.

[00:12:18.200] - Chris
Them are charging for, they want to be a part of. Now the question is, can we do that in our industry? I think we can. I think there's examples, I think some of the conversations and we don't work in this business and we've never seen it firsthand, but we've seen stuff on LinkedIn and so forth like Watley's Business Emergency, Pack Out Co, right? So California.

[00:12:36.150] - Chris
They're pursuing the hug.

[00:12:37.800] - Chris
There's a level of focus and intentionality and drive across the team to make their customers feel good in a time that otherwise feels pretty crappy contents, right? Yeah, they're a contents business. Their task is to earn. The Hug is what they rally around and it's like, oh my God, that feels good.

[00:12:57.580] - Chris
There's a certain feeling that they're chasing.

[00:12:59.700] - Chris
As a company for their customer and for them.

[00:13:03.290] - Chris
I think that's an example of kind.

[00:13:05.550] - Chris
Of what we're talking about is if you get people that really buy into.

[00:13:08.650] - Chris
That, then I'm sure they still have.

[00:13:12.350] - Chris
Behavior issues, they still have non compliance people that don't meet the standard and there's got to be corrective actions.

[00:13:18.070] - Brandon
There's still accountability, there's still accountability issues.

[00:13:21.180] - Chris
And it sounds like they're playing from that Peterson playbook.

[00:13:25.470] - Brandon
So I think one of the things that's a little interesting here and you've tied into it before with in terms of leading above the line, right, that whole deathmer piece and part of what they talk about like the five levels of motivation, right? And we get down deep right into that, not just intrinsic, but then there's these next tiers, like the super elite tier and you get into play and you get into love.

[00:13:49.320] - Chris
And I think that at first glance.

[00:13:51.590] - Brandon
When people listen to that word or hear it, there's a bunch of knee jerk responses to that. But I think what they're really kind of the heart of the matter is this idea of getting better at identifying people's natural wirings, their skill sets, those things, that when they do it, there's a level of motivation behind it that really has nothing to do with you.

[00:14:11.650] - Chris
Saying add a girl, add a boy.

[00:14:13.880] - Brandon
It's their own motivation. You and I talk about that in our business. Like, there's elements of what you and I do that we like, and then there's elements. Right. Just like with any business that have to be done in order for you to win, in order for you to succeed. But they're not necessarily at the top of my motivational chart. It's like, this has to be done. And to a certain extent, you and I are just buying our time before it's like, hey, when can this be delegated? Because we don't enjoy it. It's not a highlight.

[00:14:41.850] - Chris
Yeah.

[00:14:42.190] - Chris
And I think what we're discovering, it's.

[00:14:44.260] - Chris
Even bigger than delegation.

[00:14:46.370] - Chris
It's like as we started hiring additional consultants and building out our team and.

[00:14:50.800] - Chris
Our creative team and so forth, you.

[00:14:53.700] - Chris
Start to see that thing that Peterson is talking about. Like, Scott, for example, is one of the people we're talking about.

[00:15:00.030] - Chris
He is intrinsically driven in ways that.

[00:15:03.430] - Chris
You and I are not.

[00:15:04.340] - Chris
Right.

[00:15:04.740] - Chris
It's almost like the idea of delegation, of getting this off my plate.

[00:15:09.080] - Chris
No, it's even more powerful than that.

[00:15:12.290] - Chris
Because really, it's giving it's giving somebody something that they want instead of, hey, this is the job I need you to do. It's like, hey, you love this type of thing. I'm going to give you an opportunity to do that and make money at that. You know what I mean?

[00:15:28.880] - Brandon
Oh, yeah, absolutely. I'm laughing right now if you're not watching this on video because literally, we make jokes about this. Scott was on our team for, like, two weeks, and one of the first things that he did while we were onboarding new clients for him was he wrote, like, this 90 page commercial complex, large loss operations manual, just to give you some insight into the kinds of things that motivate him and how we're so excited when he came onto the team. Because just like what you're saying, that's his own initiative.

[00:15:59.590] - Chris
He saw the room and the freedom.

[00:16:02.120] - Brandon
To do a thing he enjoyed. And what was it? It was create this massive operations manual that obviously something we share with our clients and our partners. So anyways, you're right. It's not just delegation. And we have to remember that, right. Because part of it is like, I feel like I don't want to do that. So I'm almost looking at like, I want to drop that on somebody else.

[00:16:21.880] - Chris
And if we really are doing this correctly, the idea would be you offload.

[00:16:26.470] - Brandon
Something for you you don't enjoy, and technically you'd be giving it to that person that no, that's actually some juice for them now. It's not all gum drops and lollipops. Like there's a reality that not every task is going to fit that bill and we can't renegotiate roles and job titles to fit every Tom, Dick and Harry's personality that we bring on the team. But I think what happens and we see teams that are really skilled at this. And I think you and I are learning to get more skilled in it, is that when you're building out your team come from the perspective of, okay, if I have this role and this is this list of tasks, and responsibilities that this job title has, and I want to be really clear about that. This job title and role has. Then when you hire. It's your job to do that in such a way that you tease out in someone. Oh, they have that natural wiring, like they're a good fit for this. Not just because they applied or because they've done it before, but because it's actually the majority of it, or a good chunk of it.

[00:17:30.190] - Brandon
Right. And maybe the curious question is what's that percentage? Like, how much of the tasks have to be in alignment with that for you to be kind of falling in the right direction? But the whole anyways, I'm blabbing the.

[00:17:41.280] - Chris
Point is just like if you interview.

[00:17:43.560] - Brandon
Somebody and identify that skill set, the natural wiring, when you place them in.

[00:17:47.460] - Chris
That seat, there's not the necessary the.

[00:17:49.380] - Brandon
Need for carrots and sticks because a big chunk of what they do throughout the day is fun for them.

[00:17:55.690] - Chris
Relatively speaking. Yeah. Part of it is looking a level.

[00:18:00.860] - Chris
Deeper when we're interviewing people.

[00:18:03.240] - Chris
Yeah. You know, all of us have I.

[00:18:04.990] - Chris
Mean, most of us have learned or.

[00:18:06.410] - Chris
Via YouTube or via college or past.

[00:18:09.120] - Chris
Mentors or whatever, like a behavioral interview style, right.

[00:18:12.380] - Chris
Most of us would agree that's probably.

[00:18:14.830] - Chris
The most effective way to interview people, hear how they've handled certain situations in the past and so forth and examples and stories and whatnot. But then there's also kind of listening between the lines. So I was on an interview with.

[00:18:27.110] - Chris
One of our clients this morning with a potential salesperson. And one of the things that I.

[00:18:33.810] - Chris
Always am trying to listen for is, well, first of all, do they like sales?

[00:18:37.530] - Chris
Right?

[00:18:37.830] - Chris
Is this something that they're intrinsically motivated to get out and stir things up and to create and to meet new people and all those things? But I'm also conscious of the fact.

[00:18:47.280] - Chris
That some of the best, most successful career salespeople I've met are not what we think of when we think of salespeople. Like, we have this charismatic picture of.

[00:19:01.090] - Chris
What a salesperson should look like, sound like. And yet some of the most successful salespeople have made the most money and moved the needle the most. They just don't have often the persona that you would expect them to have being super gregarious. And like whatever image you have of salespeople in your mind really attractive, super high energy, DA DA DA. And it was do you index heavily.

[00:19:25.080] - Brandon
On the very attractive part because you yourself have a sales background? I always wonder. I feel like the attractive in quotes part comes up a lot when you describe salespeople, and I just can't tell what part is.

[00:19:37.350] - Chris
I just always presented those really attractive people. It's like, those lucky sons of bitches. No, everybody knows what I mean. We all are drawn to attractive people, let's face it. So I'd never hurt somebody's sales.

[00:19:49.100] - Brandon
Yeah.

[00:19:49.690] - Chris
I certainly don't think I without the personality or character to match it, though. Right. That's where us lesser folks can win, right? Where we can compete. That's right. But it's interesting. This person that we were interviewing was.

[00:20:06.760] - Chris
Very green, very nervous, not a lot of background.

[00:20:10.550] - Chris
But one of the things I was.

[00:20:12.130] - Chris
Hearing was the character. And there's certain character traits that I think help salespeople be disproportionately effective, where.

[00:20:23.940] - Chris
They'Re really grounded in care for others.

[00:20:27.130] - Chris
Right. When you combine deep care and concern.

[00:20:31.760] - Chris
For others with an energy and drive.

[00:20:34.990] - Chris
To create, even if somebody has maybe.

[00:20:40.190] - Chris
A more flat personality, not as gregarious and out there, but when there's this.

[00:20:45.060] - Chris
Deep care for others interests and this.

[00:20:49.860] - Chris
Hunger drive to learn, to grow, to be the best version of themselves, you're hearing those kind of things.

[00:20:55.960] - Chris
Like, this guy was talking about how he felt like he kind of could.

[00:21:00.710] - Chris
Have been more intentional with athletics and stuff in high school, that he had some talent, but he didn't put the effort in. And he discovered this when he was 19 and started working out every day and developed those disciplines and how he has some regret that, man, I wish I had taken this more seriously. Those kind of things. Like, you hear this internal drive for growth that's that intrinsic level of stuff.

[00:21:22.810] - Chris
That you can plug that into your business and a lot's going to happen.

[00:21:29.680] - Chris
Yeah, right. You cast the right vision for somebody like that and there's things that they're going to intrinsically grab onto that are satisfying for them. And you start building your company with people like that.

[00:21:42.030] - Chris
Right.

[00:21:42.500] - Chris
It's interesting. As I say that out loud, I identify those two traits. I think, oh, my gosh, right? Imagine if you could build a company of people that have a deep concern.

[00:21:53.000] - Chris
For others and an internal drive to learn and grow.

[00:21:57.580] - Chris
If you just focused on finding those two traits, who cares what those people look like? Who cares how charismatic and fun and high energy they were? Like, what could you do with the.

[00:22:08.520] - Chris
Team of people that have a deep.

[00:22:10.980] - Chris
Concern for others and a desire to.

[00:22:13.210] - Chris
Grow and become better in their own lanes?

[00:22:16.290] - Chris
In their own lanes? Whatever it is. You can have the nerdy people, you can have the quiet people, you can have the folks that are very linear thinking, the creative folks, all of it. It's like boy, there's a lot you can do with just those two character traits, right?

[00:22:30.510] - Chris
All right, Headhart and Boots listeners wanted to stop here just a moment and thank our underwriting sponsor, Bloodlight Consulting Group. As all of you know, right, brandon and I, this is our passion project, head Heart and Boots is, but it's also a way more and more that our consulting clients find us and in effect, they interview us, right?

[00:22:50.630] - Chris
Those of you been listening to Show.

[00:22:51.690] - Chris
For a while, you get to know who we are, right, what we're about. So if Head, Heart, Boots is valuable to you, one of the best things you can do is share it with your friends. And it's been incredible to watch just the audience grow. And we still get text messages from many of you about shows that you really like and impacted you. So that's number one. And please keep doing that. Many of you have been huge advocates of the show. We also just want to remind you, too, if you're a restoration company owner and you're interested in a partner in your growth, you want some help building out systems, developing your leadership teams, helping set up the infrastructure for you to scale and grow into the company that you're trying to build.

[00:23:29.800] - Brandon
That's what we do.

[00:23:30.800] - Chris
That's what we do is we come alongside restoration company leaders, we help equip them and we help support them in that growth trajectory. So if you're looking for that go to floodlightgrp.com, potentially we could be a great match for each other.

[00:23:43.900] - Brandon
Another way that we really do serve our client base and our sphere of influence is through our Premier partners. We work really hard to vet those folks that we believe bring a level of value to the industry, that it can really be leveraged in a way to have a sincere, positive impact on your business. We take that very seriously. The folks that we create, those kind of ongoing partnerships, that's not a check the box kind of scenario. We really see strategic alignment in the value that they bring. We see value in the way that their leadership teams and their partners are developed. And we've done very sincere work of ensuring that these folks that we introduce our clients and our sphere to can actually create vetted value. So go check out Bud Lightgrp.com Premierpartners and see if there's some folks on there that you can connect with and begin developing some other resources to support your growth and your business. It's interesting because I think at least this is happening with me. So I don't want to place judgment or assumptions on other people listening, but.

[00:24:41.440] - Chris
I hear that am I oversimplifying?

[00:24:43.670] - Brandon
Well, I don't even know that you're oversimplifying, but I hear what you're saying. I'm like, oh, gosh, yeah, that would be great. Chris like that. I build an entire company of people that are self driven and intrinsically motivated.

[00:24:56.130] - Chris
However, you're not wrong.

[00:24:58.190] - Brandon
I think the challenge maybe or where that gap can be is that our younger workforce and I don't even mean that necessarily by age, I just mean the newer workforce maybe is a better way to maybe think about that. There's just been a life skills development gap. I think part of it is, and.

[00:25:19.540] - Chris
I don't want to freaking backseat drive.

[00:25:22.760] - Brandon
This concept, but it's hard for me to understand why exactly, but there's just a large group of people entering the workforce that in broad life experience is lacking. It's just lacking. And so when they come into a system, they don't even know how to be a good employee and it's not necessarily a hit on them. It's not necessarily a lack of drive or caring. I think it's interpreted that way often. But I just think there's this element.

[00:25:51.770] - Chris
Of our role as leaders and business.

[00:25:54.680] - Brandon
Owners is changing a little bit to the extent of how much energy or how much development or commitment we have to give to creating a system where we can help people identify what you're talking about. So if we can design an interview process that allows us to unpack and see some of the raw clay, the raw potential, then I think ultimately part of your job then, once they're on the team, is to begin. To steward that relationship and continue to point them and move them into the seats that most align with how they.

[00:26:26.800] - Chris
Will intrinsically be motivated. Now hear me here.

[00:26:30.610] - Brandon
We are such huge proponents of not negotiating roles and titles by people's personalities. That's not what I'm saying because that'll be totally counter.

[00:26:39.300] - Chris
But what are you saying?

[00:26:40.380] - Chris
Development path?

[00:26:41.300] - Brandon
It's a development path and it doesn't have to be linear. Meaning if they come in as a tech, don't pigeonhole into them staying in that field operations role, you may accidentally have realized, right, like when you interviewed them, a lot of self accountability, a lot of motivation, just excitement to be on a team and get started great. And you start them in a tech position, well then part of your cadence with a one on one is to begin to learn more in depth knowledge about your person. Now the interesting thing is that we.

[00:27:11.600] - Chris
Have Joey Coleman coming up soon, right?

[00:27:14.680] - Chris
This afternoon, yeah.

[00:27:15.840] - Brandon
So we're going to talk to him this afternoon when you guys have the chance to hear it. We'll be several weeks, at least a couple of weeks out, I think.

[00:27:21.860] - Chris
But point is, he's going to get.

[00:27:23.810] - Brandon
Into some of this and Joey, he's going to rock. But my point is that we do have some stewarding responsibilities to help our people identify these things because I think many of them won't know. They couldn't tell you, hey, I'm passionate about XYZ. I love this thing. This is what I'm designed to do.

[00:27:42.210] - Chris
It would make it a whole hell.

[00:27:43.270] - Brandon
Of a lot easier right during the interview process.

[00:27:45.620] - Chris
But just think about it like.

[00:27:46.930] - Brandon
US as business owners and key leaders struggle to be able to put our finger on that all the time, let alone someone that maybe this is only their first or second go at some form of career or formal job. You know what I mean?

[00:27:59.930] - Chris
Yeah, no, I hear you, man.

[00:28:02.890] - Chris
So part of this whole equation is, I think sometimes we're drawn either one.

[00:28:08.030] - Chris
To people like ourselves.

[00:28:08.960] - Chris
We talked about that as a problem.

[00:28:11.790] - Chris
We're trying to recruit people that are just like us because we successful in our role, right? Whether you're a department leader or an owner or whatever. It's like we are the successful prototype and so we want to hire more.

[00:28:22.110] - Chris
Of us, more of me.

[00:28:24.050] - Chris
Everything will work out. But I think too, we have these.

[00:28:26.930] - Chris
Archetypes in our head of what a.

[00:28:29.590] - Chris
Successful person in a particular role looks like. And we've talked about this before too. The value of an after action review, even on good jobs, is sometimes we don't know why we're winning.

[00:28:39.570] - Chris
Right?

[00:28:40.150] - Chris
We make a lot of assumptions about why we're winning.

[00:28:42.450] - Chris
And I think maybe part of the.

[00:28:44.730] - Chris
Answer is what Jordan Peterson is pointing to is that the real thing that motivates success and the success we're having in our teams is much deeper than.

[00:28:54.620] - Chris
The personalities and stuff that we're normally.

[00:28:58.880] - Chris
Looking for in interviews. And I would say in my experience with salespeople, again, that's often been true, that we're looking for a certain kind of individual. And when they don't check all those.

[00:29:09.390] - Chris
Boxes, we're like, I'm not feeling it, but we kind. Of walked right past some of these golden attributes that potentially have the power.

[00:29:21.400] - Chris
To drive much more success than the good looks or the clever quips. And whatever salesy person that they are.

[00:29:32.330] - Brandon
Here, I'm going to challenge you a little bit here.

[00:29:34.150] - Chris
I don't know if it's a challenge.

[00:29:35.850] - Brandon
Let's give somebody some tactical ways to think about what we're talking about because it does seem a little too far.

[00:29:43.200] - Chris
Like 45,000ft.

[00:29:45.110] - Brandon
It's a great concept.

[00:29:46.180] - Chris
I get it. Love it, actually. But how do we find this stuff out?

[00:29:51.400] - Brandon
And I know you're the question guy, right? We were talking to some clients the other day. So one of the things that I've learned actually we were problem solving with a client the other day and one of the things I had mentioned to them is I'm kind of putting on my crisp brain right now and I've got like three or four questions I need to ask you, basically. So what are the questions, let's say.

[00:30:10.470] - Chris
In a one on one environment, and.

[00:30:12.310] - Brandon
If you've heard many of our shows, the leading by walking around environment, what are some of the questions we can be asking people to unpack this? Because, again, let's make the assumption not everyone comes preloaded with the ability to communicate it, that we need to help them find it and figure it out. Right? Not only so that we can lead them more optimally, but so that they can get more excited about the moves that they'll be making in our organization.

[00:30:35.290] - Chris
What are those questions?

[00:30:36.510] - Brandon
To dig that out?

[00:30:38.110] - Chris
Yeah. What really matters to you?

[00:30:41.020] - Chris
Like, if we right now, tomorrow as a company, we could afford to pay you $100,000 a year to do whatever really matters to you, what would that be?

[00:30:51.310] - Chris
What if you could create the perfect.

[00:30:52.740] - Chris
Role where you're spending all your time on what matters to you the most?

[00:30:56.040] - Chris
Yeah.

[00:30:56.370] - Brandon
What would that look like?

[00:30:57.320] - Chris
Yeah.

[00:30:58.530] - Brandon
As you ask those questions, are you.

[00:31:00.370] - Chris
Fearful that once you open that door.

[00:31:03.550] - Brandon
Or that you're opening some wrong answer? Yeah. Or just that once you start opening the door to those kinds of questions, are you concerned that if you can't deliver almost immediately on this package that they communicate to you that you're going.

[00:31:18.440] - Chris
To lose their motivation or lose their engagement?

[00:31:21.990] - Chris
I think in the past I have been I think my natural instinct is yeah.

[00:31:26.240] - Chris
To be afraid of their answer because.

[00:31:28.250] - Chris
If it doesn't somehow align with where.

[00:31:29.650] - Chris
I'm going or what we're trying to.

[00:31:31.330] - Chris
Do or what the company needs right now, that's going to become a negative for them to have verbalized that and.

[00:31:40.550] - Chris
Not to have it somehow for us.

[00:31:43.170] - Chris
Not to somehow answer that desire.

[00:31:46.210] - Chris
And I've also seen we've talked about Joey and the whole media director thing.

[00:31:53.030] - Chris
That we created at our last company. That kind of question is what led to us having a full time videographer on our team that really became a big differentiator for our brand in our.

[00:32:03.290] - Chris
Local market and was super satisfying for.

[00:32:08.250] - Chris
Him, an amazing role and we couldn't do it immediately. That's true.

[00:32:12.410] - Brandon
So what do you do to offset that?

[00:32:14.010] - Chris
You think oftentimes there's a way to leverage that desire in the short term.

[00:32:20.280] - Chris
In small ways to give them an outlet for that.

[00:32:23.650] - Chris
I think what it is is it forces us as leaders to actually cultivate.

[00:32:30.980] - Chris
A relationship with our people. And what do you do in relationship? Right. Relationships are reciprocal.

[00:32:36.270] - Chris
It's like, hey, gosh, if that's where.

[00:32:38.470] - Chris
You really want to head, here's what.

[00:32:39.680] - Chris
I need from you now, but here's.

[00:32:41.180] - Chris
What I could also do for you now. I think you can engage in that.

[00:32:45.510] - Chris
Negotiation of that's really amazing that you're so passionate about that.

[00:32:50.500] - Chris
How do you think we could fold that into the current role we have you in? Because I can't. Like, I need you. I need you doing this thing also.

[00:32:58.730] - Chris
Yeah.

[00:32:59.240] - Chris
But what do you think would be a step towards that direction that we.

[00:33:02.410] - Chris
Could equip you with?

[00:33:04.250] - Chris
How could we allow you to nurture.

[00:33:06.900] - Chris
That desire while still having you be.

[00:33:09.870] - Chris
A rock star in this current role?

[00:33:11.510] - Brandon
Yeah, no, I think that's a good line of questions. Right. I think when I hear you say that there's two things that are happening, one is you're keeping that door open, meaning I didn't ask you that.

[00:33:19.860] - Chris
So that when you did provide the.

[00:33:22.210] - Brandon
Answer, there was no substance to it. And though you're being realistic about let's be clear about what I mean here and about what this looks like for us to partner and head this direction together. Yeah, I think there's some key elements there. It's interesting. I think an example might be I'm just thinking about a couple of the interviews we've had over the last couple of days. So some of you know and by the way, if you don't know this, please spread word to your network, to people in your sphere. If there's a business leader, somebody from our industry with an industry background that you respect, you admire, you really respect the way they behave, the way they've carried themselves, the successes that they've achieved, please point them in our direction. We are actively looking to add a team member, another senior consultant to our staff. That being said, boy, are we fortunate. We've had some really rad interviews over the last couple of days. I feel so honored that this caliber of people want to potentially be a part of our team. So anyways, we're having a discussion with.

[00:34:20.310] - Chris
Somebody and one of the things that.

[00:34:22.150] - Brandon
Kind of came out on their own accord and I don't think it really aligned necessarily with the question we asked. They just talked about how much they actually like the teaching training aspect. And for those of you that have heard us talk about this before there's.

[00:34:34.330] - Chris
A very big difference between coaching, consulting and training.

[00:34:38.660] - Brandon
There are three different activities and behaviors and there's different skill sets that you deploy in each of those. But anyways, my point was that they talked very openly about their excitement around training and teaching. And of course we're listening for that because you and I both know that we need those folks on our team because part of what we want to continue to challenge ourselves to do is create really high end content and curriculum for our people, for our clients.

[00:35:03.300] - Chris
And so we heard that, and then.

[00:35:05.730] - Brandon
I immediately my brain starts strategizing, okay, well, if we bring them on, this is how we could deploy that. This is how we would partner with them. Right. For them to stay in that lane as often as possible. But then how do we segue or communicate where these other expectations are that they and then I think part of what you and I do in that process, too is we're asking questions to identify. Are we going to ask you to be outside of that lane too much?

[00:35:27.880] - Chris
And if we are, then you and.

[00:35:29.480] - Brandon
I have a hard decision to make.

[00:35:30.730] - Chris
Because essentially we can't give them what.

[00:35:33.130] - Brandon
They ultimately would want, right. Or could be successful in this particular case. I think we can.

[00:35:38.090] - Chris
But you know what I'm saying? Yeah. I think it's just a new way.

[00:35:41.250] - Chris
Of thinking about our business. And a lot of conversation is happening.

[00:35:46.080] - Chris
Within all employers and leaders right now.

[00:35:49.310] - Chris
Of how do we connect with this new generation? Because they see things differently, they experience things differently. They want different things for themselves.

[00:35:55.810] - Brandon
Right.

[00:35:56.580] - Chris
And I think some of the bedrock of that is that they've watched their parents, grandparents, great grandparents, do this whole nose to the grindstone thing for 30 years and then have fun and then suffer silent rewards, suffer silently. Basically, lay down your own life for your pay, for your kids college, and then buy the nice RV for your spouse, and then go enjoy yourselves in your golden years or what are supposed to be golden years. And then we've watched them all get diabetes and heart disease and struggle to walk around because they've spent themselves on.

[00:36:29.890] - Brandon
Their career and not necessarily being rewarded from that experience, maybe financially to a certain extent.

[00:36:35.850] - Chris
Sure.

[00:36:37.310] - Chris
I think there's that a lot of the upcoming generation is like, no, none of us are guaranteed those golden years. They've seen that play out. None of us are guaranteed to enjoy it or even have the money at the end of it, market crashes and all this kind of craziness that they've seen.

[00:36:51.890] - Chris
And so I think that's part of.

[00:36:53.440] - Chris
It is, how do I create a.

[00:36:54.570] - Chris
Life in conjunction with my work?

[00:36:57.350] - Chris
And then I think also, we were just talking with well, in one of.

[00:37:00.740] - Chris
Our workshops how this generation is so accustomed to these points of affirmation all the time, constantly.

[00:37:10.640] - Chris
I made this post about this thing. I put this picture out. I got 25 likes from my friends. I got 14 comments on that thing. There's these points of affirmation and feedback.

[00:37:21.370] - Chris
That they're accustomed to getting all the.

[00:37:23.410] - Chris
Time, all the time, every day. And then they go into a work.

[00:37:26.670] - Chris
Environment where we're like, just do the job. Do a good job and you'll be.

[00:37:33.890] - Chris
Eligible to earn your bonus and your annual pay raise and just do what we hired you to do. Why do you need all the pats on the back? We don't say that out loud because we kind of understand that. But I think we haven't learned as.

[00:37:49.050] - Chris
Leaders how to lead this new generation.

[00:37:52.330] - Chris
We were accustomed to leading people that just knew they had to put their time in.

[00:37:55.940] - Chris
Yeah.

[00:37:56.490] - Brandon
And it's interesting because if you think about it from a social media perspective, right, wrong or indifference, it's kind of irrelevant, right? It just is. Right? Those elements that just are, I think, from a social media world or perspective, I think that we need to also come to grips with the fact that they are hearing on a consistent cadence that they do not have to succumb and make sacrifices just to do what they think the community or culture says they should do.

[00:38:22.740] - Chris
Even though if we're honest about it.

[00:38:25.670] - Brandon
They'Re just doing some other version of it.

[00:38:27.430] - Chris
But think about that from a social media perspective.

[00:38:31.160] - Brandon
They're hearing constantly. Do you you, do you, you be you find what you're passionate about. There's a way to make money, a way to thrive. There's a group, a community, something that aligns with who you are, just you being you, right?

[00:38:45.860] - Chris
So they're hearing that, let's call it.

[00:38:48.150] - Brandon
23 out of the 24 hours a day. And then they come into your institution and really hear none of that. They hear, just do as I say, do what you're told, do what the job title says, right? Like this. Very counter. And so I think one of the realities that we're dealing with as leaders is, guys, we have to learn how to meet them. Like you can't act as if you're going to build an organization that's so.

[00:39:11.480] - Chris
Counterculture that people somehow are going to just switch teams.

[00:39:18.120] - Brandon
They're not going to make that. They're not going to bridge that gap. We've got to do something in the way that we're teaching and communicating with our people that does align with that message because it's a powerful message, right? We got to be careful of time. But I was just thinking about we had a really cool discussion yesterday, just totally friend to friend, right? Industry friends. We were talking to Mark Springer and man, I know probably a lot of our listeners have seen him on other podcasts or maybe had some exchange with him as part of his leadership with RIA and things like that. I was just blown away by the.

[00:39:50.450] - Chris
Caliber of individual that I felt like he portrayed, right?

[00:39:55.300] - Brandon
There was just so much humility, so much calm demeanor, consistent, just very confident, but in all the right ways. Not that weird, ego driven way.

[00:40:06.230] - Chris
Anyways, point being is he was talking.

[00:40:08.980] - Brandon
About the early years. Anybody that knows anything about Fleet, like.

[00:40:12.500] - Chris
Holy crud, they are jamming, right?

[00:40:16.660] - Brandon
Part of a massive M and A movement. They are growing leaps and bounds, dumb numbers. I won't talk about those, that's for Mark's words. But the reality of it is that even where they started before they became the foundation of an M and A platform, they were winning. And they were winning at a very high level. And in my book, what I've seen often is that that happens because of who's at the helm and the team.

[00:40:41.710] - Chris
They built around them intentionally.

[00:40:43.810] - Brandon
When we were asking him questions, one of the first areas he went was his excitement.

[00:40:49.310] - Chris
This is the key, his excitement about.

[00:40:52.660] - Brandon
His role in building the team.

[00:40:55.590] - Chris
Building the team.

[00:40:56.310] - Chris
And he said it like four times in the conversation. Building teams and executing.

[00:41:00.730] - Brandon
Building teams and executing. That was his key. That was his thing, literally. So it's like, I hear that and I go, okay, well, I know where.

[00:41:06.630] - Chris
His juice is, right?

[00:41:07.980] - Brandon
I know what lane he wants to be in. And he clearly has identified that. And then he communicated to you that some of the stuff he's had to do over the last four or five, six years as part of this strategy. Is it's taking him sometimes out of that lane? And he's talked about the toll of that like it has an emotional toll and physical toll on you. Anyways, point being, it's like, okay, again, we're not going to go into numbers, listen to stuff.

[00:41:32.030] - Chris
He's been fantastically successful level, right.

[00:41:34.900] - Brandon
Levels that most of us won't comprehend. And the reality of it is because he found the lane that he was passionate about, that he was intrinsically driven by, and he stayed in that lane and he built a team around him so that he could continue to be in that lane and focus on that thing and you can see the results. And so I think part of what I guess I'm going with that is.

[00:41:56.450] - Chris
You guys, even as leaders, we're not.

[00:41:59.290] - Brandon
Going to be all things to our people. It doesn't even matter if you're the owner. Like, you're just not going to be all things. You may very well not be the team builder. That might not be the thing that's your sweet spot. Do I suggest heavily that you've got ground to gain there and you need to continue to stretch and grow yourself? Absolutely, 100%.

[00:42:18.570] - Chris
And though, look for that partner, that.

[00:42:21.370] - Brandon
Team member, that leader that you can bring in, it that loves it. Maybe that's that extra layer that you bring into the team. Don't shortchange what you could possibly do because something falls out of your natural wiring or your natural skill set. Right. Don't throw a hand grenade in the whole system. Anyways, we got a little wordy there.

[00:42:40.050] - Chris
But do you have maybe just a.

[00:42:42.390] - Brandon
Thought or two to kind of help land the plane and draw this curtain?

[00:42:45.600] - Chris
Man yeah.

[00:42:46.710] - Chris
Well, I just think coming back to.

[00:42:47.860] - Chris
The original topic of turnover, it's so.

[00:42:52.730] - Chris
Hard to get talent, it's so painful to watch them walk out the door. And of course, this isn't just with Millennials generation next, whatever the current word is for the young people coming into our businesses. It's across the board.

[00:43:06.510] - Chris
The energy that the younger generation employees.

[00:43:10.280] - Chris
Is bringing to the business, it's starting.

[00:43:12.480] - Chris
To distribute across all of our employees.

[00:43:16.790] - Chris
Because I think there's something intrinsic that all of us have felt throughout our careers. There's a desire for meaning. There's a desire for what we're doing every day to be satisfying. I think even those of us who are in our 40s, we understand at some level we understand, yeah, I'm not going to grind my face off for 30 years and maybe not even make it, maybe sacrifice my marriage or the quality of my family relationships to get ahead in my career and all that. We understand. I think what's pushing the younger people to say, no, I'm not playing that game. And at the same time, we just haven't quite figured out how to lead in that environment. I think what we're talking about here and maybe we are talking in idealistic terms and Jordan Peterson is laying out this is the target and we're never going to fully reach it.

[00:44:09.040] - Brandon
But you can march towards yeah, it's.

[00:44:10.710] - Chris
Like, okay, how can we start to.

[00:44:12.370] - Chris
Tune our minds, to get curious about.

[00:44:16.680] - Chris
What people's underlying motivation is? What do they want? Because I think it's possible that somebody can want something that doesn't automatically make.

[00:44:27.350] - Chris
Us think mitigation technician, but it can.

[00:44:32.630] - Chris
Still feed that we can create a role in an environment for them that feeds that thing they're looking for. We were talking about how just this for you and I, and there's different versions of this, we all tell ourselves a little bit different story. But for me, the hero part of our business is very satisfying to me, even now as a consultant that I get to be a part of. That where we're saving the day, we're helping people turn a corner from a negative experience to a positive. Like, I love that role, but we all love it, maybe for different reasons. And it's like learning how to tell a better story about what our people are signing up for, finding out what is it that they care about, what is meaningful to the people, and getting into that conversation and interviews. And then I think the other thing, too, that we just barely touched on.

[00:45:23.270] - Chris
And I think we should come back to is Affirming, right? I think if leaders in previous generations.

[00:45:31.330] - Chris
Had been better at spotting the good things that people are doing, better at praising the wins, better at praising alignment to the common mission and objectives and vision, I think they would have been even more productive than past generations were. And I think we're learning that. And our younger employees are saying, I want Affirmation. I don't care if you think it's right or wrong. I don't care if you think I'm high maintenance. This is how I've grown up. This is what I've grown to expect. And I want to be told when I'm doing a good job. I want to be told when I'm making an impact. I want to be told when you like me, when you like something I did. And so I think we can choose.

[00:46:09.430] - Chris
To be annoyed by it or we.

[00:46:11.850] - Chris
Can choose to play a better game.

[00:46:13.900] - Chris
Yeah, play to win, right?

[00:46:15.480] - Chris
Play to win. And I just love that analogy too.

[00:46:18.730] - Chris
Is they're used to emojis, they're used.

[00:46:20.990] - Chris
To the likes, they're used to the thumbs up, they're used to this stuff. It's like, how do we give them more of that? Because it clearly drives behavior.

[00:46:28.660] - Chris
Shit.

[00:46:29.060] - Chris
How often are people and us now looking at our phones to see how many people, like that Instagram post that we put up or that LinkedIn post that we created that article, we shared that video.

[00:46:40.940] - Chris
We all do it now.

[00:46:44.450] - Chris
So how do we build that into.

[00:46:46.150] - Chris
The way we're leading?

[00:46:47.890] - Chris
How do we touch people at a deeper level that makes them want to commit to us and be loyal to the vision and the mission that we're on.

[00:46:56.470] - Chris
I think it requires a little bit different behavior now. Yeah, I agree. Okay.

[00:47:02.300] - Chris
Wow.
